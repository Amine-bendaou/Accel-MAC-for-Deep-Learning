There is a large setup violation of -4.715 ns between DUT/NormalizationShifter/level5_d2_reg[19]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and C_internal_reg[4]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
