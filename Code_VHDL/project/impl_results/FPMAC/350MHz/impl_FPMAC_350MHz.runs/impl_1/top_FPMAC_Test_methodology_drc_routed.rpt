There is a large setup violation of -4.203 ns between C_internal_reg[13]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and DUT/RightShifterComponent/level5_d1_reg[35]/R (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
