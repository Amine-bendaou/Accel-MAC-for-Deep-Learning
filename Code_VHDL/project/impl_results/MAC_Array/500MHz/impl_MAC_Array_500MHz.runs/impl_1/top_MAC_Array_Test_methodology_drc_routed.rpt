There is a large setup violation of -4.029 ns between MAC_GEN[0].MAC_INST/add_inst/aligned_x_1_reg[8]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and MAC_GEN[0].MAC_INST/add_inst/r_mant_2_reg[39]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#639 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.050 ns between MAC_GEN[0].MAC_INST/add_inst/aligned_x_1_reg[8]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and MAC_GEN[0].MAC_INST/add_inst/r_mant_2_reg[37]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
