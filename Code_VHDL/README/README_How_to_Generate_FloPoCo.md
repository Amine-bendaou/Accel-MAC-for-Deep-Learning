# How to Generate FloPoCo Operators

This guide explains how to manually generate **floating-point operators** (Addition, Multiplication, Multiply-Accumulate) using **FloPoCo**.  
These commands are typically run from the terminal.

## ‚öôÔ∏è General Syntax

```bash
flopoco <Operator> wE=<EXP_WIDTH> wF=<MANT_WIDTH> frequency=<FREQ> name=<ENTITY_NAME>
```

Where:
- `<Operator>`     = Type of block (e.g., IEEEFPAdd, FPMult, IEEEFPFMA)  
- `<EXP_WIDTH>`    = Width of the exponent (e.g., 5)  
- `<MANT_WIDTH>`   = Width of the mantissa (e.g., 10)  
- `<FREQ>`         = Target frequency in MHz (e.g., 300)  
- `<ENTITY_NAME>`  = Name given to the VHDL entity (e.g., FPAdd16)

## ‚ûï Floating-Point Addition (IEEE 754)

**Command:**
```bash
flopoco IEEEFPAdd wE=5 wF=10 frequency=300 name=FPAdd16
```

**Description:**  
Generates a floating-point adder named `FPAdd16` with:  
- Exponent width = 5 bits  
- Mantissa width = 10 bits  
- Target frequency = 300 MHz

## ‚úñÔ∏è Floating-Point Multiplication

**Command:**
```bash
flopoco FPMult wE=5 wF=10 frequency=300 name=FPMult16
```

**Description:**  
Generates a floating-point multiplier named `FPMult16` with:  
- Exponent width = 5 bits  
- Mantissa width = 10 bits  
- Target frequency = 300 MHz

## üîÅ Floating-Point Multiply-Accumulate (MAC)

**Command:**
```bash
flopoco IEEEFPFMA wE=5 wF=10 frequency=300 name=FPMAC16
```

**Description:**  
Generates a floating-point Fused Multiply-Add block named `FPMAC16` with:  
- Exponent width = 5 bits  
- Mantissa width = 10 bits  
- Target frequency = 300 MHz  

**Note:**  
Fused Multiply-Add computes `(A * B + C)` with a single rounding, improving performance and accuracy.

## üìù Notes

- After running the command, FloPoCo creates a `flopoco.vhdl` file containing the generated operator.  
- You can rename and move this file as needed, or use scripts to integrate it into your project (e.g., `generate_vhdl.py` will do this automatically).  
- Ensure `flopoco` is installed and accessible from your PATH.  
- The final report generated by FloPoCo includes **timing and pipeline info**.  
  Example:
```text
Entity FPAdd16
   R: (c5, 2.921026ns)
```
This means the output is ready after 5 pipeline cycles. You can use this value when defining latencies in your testbenches or wrappers.

- To test your FloPoCo code in either **Test Bench** or **Implementation** mode, add the top-level file located at:  
```
STAGE-LAAS-CNRS-2025/CODE_VHDL/Top level text file flopoco
```
Then, select the appropriate top-level configuration based on whether you're testing with a single value or with 16 values.  
If using the 16-value configuration, adjust the latency by setting the correct value found in the FloPoCo report.
